\section{Target}
The target of the implementation is to use the video from a web cam to test the implemented color based face detection. The implemented code should as simple as possible, to achieve a real-time capable 

\section{Implementation steps}
Following steps will be done to test if the implemented solution is real-time capable.

\subsection{Color based phase detection on a picture}
The first step is to test the algorithms on different pictures. For this following steps are scheduled:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Transform picture into the
\item Find suitable threshold ranges for the YCbCr.
\item Make Thresholding on the YCbCr to get a binary picture.
\item Detecting phases out of skin regions.
\item Draw boxes to identify the faces on the picture.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Color based phase detection on a video}
Use a web cam and test the implemented color based algorithm.
\subsection{Real-time Color based phase detection on a picture}
There are three posibilities to test if the implemented solution is real-time capable.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Test it on a notebook and a webcam (same as section xx).
\item Calculate if the computation time is less enough for a micro controller like a Arduino.
\end{enumerate}
